    IAuthenticationService objects are used to implement

    expected to collaborate with services in other contexts. Client
    code doesn't search a context and call multiple services. Instead,
    client code will call the most specific service in a place and
    rely on the service to delegate to other services as necessary.

    The interface doesn't include methods for data
    management. Services may use external data and not allow
    management in Zope. Simularly, the data to be managed may vary
    with different implementations of a service.

        The request object is fairly opaque. We may decide

        Implementation note

        It is likely that the component will dispatch
        to another component based on the actual
        request interface. This will allow different
        kinds of requests to be handled correctly.

        For example, a component that authenticates
        based on user names and passwords might request
        an adapter for the request as in::

          getpw=getAdapter(request,
                       ILoginPassword, place=self)

        The place keyword argument is used to control
